Student Environment
-------------------------
It is expected that students have completed a full year of Java programming in high school or just over a semester of programming at the college level.

We use [jGRASP](http://www.jgrasp.org/) as our IDE of choice when working with High School students, but any Java IDE can be used that is capable of adding a jar to a classpath and executing a class from within the jar as the main class.
