Survivor [Basic Game]
=============

<a name="overview"></a>Overview
-----------

**Survivor** is a basic game which is a great motivator for learning about radar.

The objective is to be the player who has survived the longest in the game world while moving.

Points are awarded for every second the player has travelled in the world.

A player's best record is used to determine their ranking, so even if your intermediate score is reset upon being destroyed, if you have travelled the longest still overall, you'll win.
