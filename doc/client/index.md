Client Setup
========
Any Java IDE should be able to be used for Space Battle Arena.

We typically use [jGRASP](http://www.jgrasp.org/) or [Eclipse](https://eclipse.org/).  Look to the **right** for some walk-throughs on setting up Space Battle using different IDEs.

The general process involves:

1. Adding both the Gson and SpaceBattle .jar files to your classpath.
2. Creating a Ship class which either extends the BasicSpaceship abstract class OR  
implements the Spaceship<?> interface.
3. Execute the TextClient's run method with the following arguments:
    1. IP address of the server
    2. An instance of your Java Ship class

    ```
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        TextClient.run("127.0.0.1", new ExampleShip());
    }
    ```

Alternatively, to the third step above, execute the TextClient's main method from within SpaceBattle.jar passing the IP Address and a string with the name of your Ship class.

If you need to run ships via the Command Line see [these instructions](CmdLine/index.html).
