There are many different types of objects you may encounter during your travels.  Be sure that your ship knows how to react to them.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Asteroid.png" alt="Asteroid" class="left"/> 
**Asteroids** float through space at a slow speed.  They may be caught in the gravity of other celestial objects.  They can be destroyed with torpedoes.  Colliding with them will cause damage.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/BlackHole.png" alt="Black Hole" class="left"/> 
**Black Holes** are stationary and you cannot collide with them.  They have massive gravity wells which can be hard to escape from with thrusters alone.  Staying too long in the center of a black hole can crush your ship.

**Constellations** are stationary decorations.  They may be useful for research in Discovery Quest though or collecting Energy.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Dragon.png" alt="Dragon" class="left"/> 
**Dragons** are hungry for ships.  If you are in their site, they will prey upon you.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Nebula.png" alt="Nebula" class="left"/> 
**Nebulas** are stationary and you cannot collide with them.  They will apply a drag to your ship and slow it down.  You can Lower your Energy Scoop to collect energy from them.  Other ships cannot detect you within a Nebula.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Planet.png" alt="Planet" class="left"/> 
**Planets** are stationary and have a gravity well.  Colliding with them will cause damage.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Quasar.png" alt="Quasar" class="left"/> 
**Quasars** are dangerous and prevent Shielding, drain your shields, and slow down energy regeneration on your ship.  In addition to the same properties as Nebulas above; however, they can't be mined for Energy.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Mine.png" alt="Space Mine" class="left"/> 
**Space Mines** are dropped by enemy ships and cause explosions which can damage you and send you off course.  Some may track and follow your ship.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Star.png" alt="Star" class="left"/> 
**Stars** are stationary and you cannot collide with them.  They are hot and will cause more damage to your ship the closer you are to their center.  You can Lower your Energy Scoop to collect energy from them.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/Torpedo.png" alt="Torpedo" class="left"/> 
**Torpedoes** are fired by enemy ships and cause damage when hit.

<img src="@(Context.Settings[Keys.LinkRoot])/img/obj/WormHole.png" alt="Worm Hole" class="left"/> 
**Worm Holes** are stationary and can transport your ship across space.  Worm Holes may connect to other worm holes, fixed locations in space, or random locations.
