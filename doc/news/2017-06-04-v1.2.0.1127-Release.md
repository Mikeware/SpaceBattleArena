We've released a HotFix release for BaubleHunt to address an issue where ships could deposit in any base instead of just their own.  Please update your server if you are participating in the cross-school tournament.  *No client changes were made.*

Please search and report to us on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues) if you see any issues. Thanks!
