title: Wyam! New Site (sort of)
abstract: We're now using Wyam to generate the site.

Today we updated the Space Battle Arena site to use the [Wyam](https://wyam.io/) static site generator.  However, it should still look the same to you!

This was to reduce the overhead needed to setup and build the site.  Hopefully, eventually we can automatically build the site when a doc item gets changed, but this will be a step towards that possibility for now.

We've also taken the time in this transition to add a few more resources to the site, enjoy!

Please report to us on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues) if you see any issues or have questions. Thanks!
