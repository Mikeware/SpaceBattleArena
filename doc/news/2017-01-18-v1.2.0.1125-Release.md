title: v1.2.0.1125 Release
abstract: Season 5's The Hunger Baubles Release.
---

Season 5 cleaned up all of the 'Bauble' games and introduced the king of them all with 'The Hunger Baubles'.  The Hunger Baubles are a game where you must hunt for the best collection of baubles.  Baubles have varying values and weights, but your ship can only carry so many.

This past year we also visited the Computer Science Teachers Association Conference in San Diego.

Work on V2 will commence soon with possible improvements to the current version.
