Today we kickoff TEALS Season 6 cross-school tournament challenge.  The final mission will consist of a challenge using Bauble Hunt and weighted baubles.  More information will be released in the coming weeks, if there is enough interest.

If your TEALS affiliated school is using Space Battle this year, please have your instructor use [this form](https://goo.gl/forms/tO05CaEBgZKjBLJS2) to let us know and receive further information about the tournament.

Work is also progressing on some client debugging tools in a separate [branch](https://github.com/Mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/tree/feat/nodeclient).  More information will be provided when simple instructions for setup are available.

Please search and report to us on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues) if you see any issues or have questions. Thanks!
