Today we kickoff the TEALS Season 9 cross-school tournament challenge.  We aim for the final mission to be a brand-new challenge built on top of our upcoming Python 3 ported version of Space Battle Arena.  More information will be released in the coming weeks.

If your school is planning to use Space Battle this year, please have your instructor use [this form](https://forms.gle/Ek4Ar1Uxy1WaJ6mf6) to let us know and receive further information about the tournament.

Please search and report to us on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues) if you see any issues or have questions. Thanks!
