Last year we kicked off our Open Source project with an improved version of Season 3's 'King of the Bubble' challenge.

We delayed the official build, but last year's Season 4 Challenge of 'Discovery Quest' is now available.

We'll be kicking off the 5th Season of Space Battle in a few weeks, so stay tuned!

Please search and report to us on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues) if you see any issues. Thanks!
