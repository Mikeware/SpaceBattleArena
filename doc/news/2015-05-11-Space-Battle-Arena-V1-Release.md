abstract: Soft V1 Release.
---

At the start of our 4th season of Space Battle, we are releasing it to the open source world.  Look for more info on the website to come in the next few days. You can download it through the links above.

We may also refresh the package with some lesson configuration files.  But this package has been fairly well tested with our new unit test framework for the basics.

Please search or report to us on [GitHub](http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues) if you see any issues. Thanks!
