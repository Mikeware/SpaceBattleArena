<p>Your Spaceship is your livelihood Cadet!  </p>

<p>Now that you have oriented yourself within the Universe, it&#39;s time to learn about telling your ship how to do perform commands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Be sure to instruct it well; as after your simulations, it must venture completely on its own.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Spaceship has three main metrics that you&#39;ll want to monitor: </p>

<ul>
<li>Health</li>
<li>Shields</li>
<li>Energy</li>
</ul>

<p>Each is a limited resource which can be used, depleted, and charged.  </p>

<p>Of course, when your ship&#39;s health is depleted it&#39;ll explode spectacularly.  You will be requisitioned a new ship at that time to continue your mission, though it may cost you some points (depending on the current mission scenario).</p>

<p>Shields will help protect your ship&#39;s health, but must be engaged pre-emptively before taking damage.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You ship can be damaged by colliding with other objects in the universe, when hit by enemy fire, or when eaten by a dragon...</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Finally, your ship has an energy reserve.  </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Any action you wish your ship to perform requires energy.</strong>  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Your ship&#39;s energy will slowly and automatically recharge over time.</p>

<h1 id="ship-control">Ship Control</h1>

<p>In order to control your ship, you must issue commands.  Your ship must decide what to do based on the information it is given and whatever you&#39;ve told it to &#39;remember&#39;.  Each command may require an initial amount of energy to perform as well as have an ongoing energy cost if the action requires a period of time to perform.  </p>

<p>Some commands must wait for the action to be completed before you can issue the next command; these are called <strong>blocking</strong> commands.  Other commands may start and continue the action while you can issue a new command (<em>non-blocking</em> commands).  It will be important for you to understand the differences in these two behaviors when programming your spaceship.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Every time your ship has &#39;completed&#39; processing a command (and waiting for it to finish if it was blocking), it will ask you to tell it what to do next.</p>

<p>This process repeats indefinitely until the mission has ended.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>An important thing to note is that your ship&#39;s computer can only be concurrently processing up to <strong>four</strong> commands at once.  If you exceed that limit, the oldest command will be &#39;forgotten&#39;.  This is important when trying to execute multiple non-blocking commands together.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If your ship does not have the required energy to continue executing a command, your <strong>energy will be depleted</strong> and the command will abort.  If you try to reissue the same command, it is possible to get stuck in a loop where you are constantly draining your ships resources but not doing anything.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Be prudent about tracking energy usage and making sure that you give yourself time to recharge or collect energy after performing large complex maneuvers.</p>
