        <p>There are many different types of objects you may encounter during your travels.  Be sure that your ship knows how to react to them.</p>

<p><strong>Asteroids</strong> float through space at a slow speed.  They may be caught in the gravity of other celestial objects.  They can be destroyed with torpedoes.  Colliding with them will cause damage.</p>

<p><strong>Planets</strong> are stationary and have a gravity well.  Colliding with them will cause damage.</p>

<p><strong>Black Holes</strong> are stationary and you cannot collide with them.  They have massive gravity wells which can be hard to escape from with thrusters alone.  Staying too long in the center of a black hole can crush your ship.</p>

<p><strong>Nebulas</strong> are stationary and you cannot collide with them.  They will apply a drag to your ship and slow it down.  You can Lower your Energy Scoop to collect energy from them.</p>

<p><strong>Stars</strong> are stationary and you cannot collide with them.  They are hot and will cause more damage to your ship the closer you are to their center.</p>
