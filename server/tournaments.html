        <h1 id="tournaments">Tournaments</h1>

<h2 id="overview"><a name="overview"></a>Overview</h2>

<p>Tournaments are a great option for the last day of using Space Battle Arena with a group.  They automatically split players up into groups and manage running multiple games in order to declare a Victor.</p>

<h2 id="setup"><a name="setup"></a>Setup</h2>

<p>A &#39;tournament.cfg&#39; is provided with the server package, so the easiest way to start a basic tournament is to include it at the end of your current game configuration:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">SBA_Serv.exe game_baublehunt.cfg tournament.cfg
</code></pre></div>
<p>This will start your Bauble Hunt subgame in tournament mode.  See the <a href="config.html">Configuration</a> section for the basic parameters involved with tournaments, and see the sections below for more advanced setups.</p>

<p>Once Space Battle Arena starts, all players should connect their Ships to the server at once.  You can use the player list to see all the connections.</p>

<p><strong>It is important for players to not disconnect during the course of the tournament.</strong> Especially, if they&#39;re continuing to another round.</p>

<p>Once all players have joined.  Hit the &#39;Space&#39; key to start the first round of the tournament.  The &#39;T&#39; key in the GUI toggles the tournament display and the &#39;P&#39; key can cycle the player list to show just the current round&#39;s players.</p>

<h2 id="basic-tournament"><a name="basic"></a>Basic Tournament</h2>

<p>The <strong>BasicTournament</strong> is the default tournament manager.  It splits players into a number of <em>groups</em> (provided in the settings, default 4) and advances the top X players from each round to a final round (X is configurable with <em>number_to_final_round</em> and defaults to 1).</p>

<p>After each initial round has completed, the final round is played with the seeded players, and a winner is crowned from the top of that pool.</p>

<h2 id="wild-tournament"><a name="wild"></a>Wild Tournament</h2>

<p>The <strong>WildTournament</strong> manager is the same as the Basic Tournament; however, there are two additional options available.  Configured by the following configuration section:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">[Wildcard]
number = integer
play_round = boolean
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="number-=-integer">number = integer</h3>

<p>Number of wildcard slots to provide.  A wildcard is the top scoring players across all players which did <strong>not</strong> advance.  This can be across groups.  Scoring is still defined by the subgame which is being played.</p>

<h3 id="play_round-=-boolean">play_round = boolean</h3>

<p>If set to true, after the preliminary rounds, but before the final, another &#39;Wildcard&#39; round will be played with the number of wildcard players specified taken from the pool of non-seeded players.  The top players from this group will advance to the final group.</p>

<p>If set to false, the number of wildcard players will automatically be added to the final round after the preliminaries finish, but before the final round begins.</p>

<h3 id="take_ties-=-boolean">take_ties = boolean</h3>

<p>If set to true, any number of players tied for scoring will advance into the bonus round or final round.</p>
