			<title>Wyam! New Site (sort of)</title>
			<link>https://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/2019/10/14/New-Site</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;Today we updated the Space Battle Arena site to use the &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt; static site generator.  However, it should still look the same to you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Today we updated the Space Battle Arena site to use the &lt;a href="https://wyam.io/"&gt;Wyam&lt;/a&gt; static site generator.  However, it should still look the same to you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was to reduce the overhead needed to setup and build the site.  Hopefully, eventually we can automatically build the site when a doc item gets changed, but this will be a step towards that possibility for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've also taken the time in this transition to add a few more resources to the site, enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please report to us on &lt;a href="http://github.com/mikeware/SpaceBattleArena/issues"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; if you see any issues or have questions. Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

			<title>Nebulas</title>
			<link>https://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/2015/05/05/Nebulas</link>
			<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/SpaceBattleArena/client/guides/img/obj/Nebula.png" alt="" class="left"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nebulas&lt;/strong&gt; will add a bit more beauty and depth to our barren space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
			<guid>https://mikeware.github.io/SpaceBattleArena/2015/05/05/Nebulas</guid>

			<content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/SpaceBattleArena/client/guides/img/obj/Nebula.png" alt="" class="left"/&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Nebulas&lt;/strong&gt; will add a bit more beauty and depth to our barren space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nebulas are larger objects within the game world, but do not cause collisions.  If ships enter a Nebula, they will be slowed down by some drag on the celestial dust.  This drag is less than the ship's thrust capacity though, so it'll not be a trap like some &lt;strong&gt;Black Holes&lt;/strong&gt; can be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nebulas actually represent an upgrade to some of the internal workings of Space Battle Arena.  Before there was a bit of a mismatch between what constituted an &lt;em&gt;Entity&lt;/em&gt; and a piece of the Physical Model.  That and everything was assumed to be round.  Now, everything is an Entity from the start, and the Physical Model builds on top of the Entity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will be possible to add &lt;em&gt;Polygonal&lt;/em&gt; shaped objects to the world which could be barriers or goals for other objectives in the future; however, remember that detecting these shapes on the client isn't as straight-forward if they're not roundish.&lt;/p&gt;
